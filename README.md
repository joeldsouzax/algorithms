# algorithms

Synopsis

This repository contains popular algorithms, I have tried to create them in C and java, but if I get more time,
then perhaps in several different languages.

Motivation

Learning algorithm is a key for becoming a good programmer, I just wanted to know the differences in C and java in the implementation
of algorithms, knowing that C is procedural and Java is Object oriented, helping me to gain a deep knowledge of how java works
behind the object oriented cover.
